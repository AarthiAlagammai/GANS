# GANS
Trained a CycleGAN to read in an image from a set $X$ and transform it so that it looks as if it belongs in set $Y$. Specifically, we'll look at a set of images of Yosemite national park taken either during the summer of winter. The seasons are our two domains!
Implemented a DCGAN to generate new images based on the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset.
Built GAN trained on MNIST dataset to generate new handwritten digits
