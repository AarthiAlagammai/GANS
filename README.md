# GANS
1.Trained a CycleGAN to read in an image from a set $X$ and transform it so that it looks as if it belongs in set $Y$. Specifically, we'll look at a set of images of Yosemite national park taken either during the summer of winter. The seasons are our two domains!                
2.Implemented a DCGAN to generate new images based on the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset.                        
3.Built GAN trained on MNIST dataset to generate new handwritten digits
